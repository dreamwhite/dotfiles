## Welcome to my dotfiles repository

The following repository is a collection of dotfiles and configuration that I personally use on my PCs. Feel free to contribute via PR and Issues ^^ 

## ZSH configuration

This is my favourite shell, after over 9 years of bash. I feel like ZSH is more extensible than bash, and has a better community support .-.
I use Oh-My-Zsh and, despite many people call it a bloatware, I only use few extensions. If you're here to complain about it, ask yourself if your brain is bloated with neurons :") 

To install Oh-My-Zsh simply follow the instructions available on the official website [here](https://ohmyz.sh)
**To simplify the paths, I've installed Oh-My-Zsh in my `~/.zshsh` folder**
I use:

- Powerlevel-10K (which basically is an update of Powerlevel-9K. I haven't found yet any difference from Powerlevel-9K. Maybe I'm simply dumb and stoned atm)
- [zsh-autosuggestions](https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-autosuggestions)
- [HeadsetControl](https://github.com/Sapd/HeadsetControl) since I own a pair of SteelSeries Arctis 7 2020 Edition ^^
- [colorls](https://github.com/athityakumar/colorls)

## iTerm2 configuration for macOS

I applied a few tweaks on the default configuration for iTerm2 on macOS but it seems fine.
You can see it [here](/dreamTerm.json)

I'm planning to migrate to Alacritty but still having issues with fonts and shit. I'll try to migrate asap to that beautiful terminal :c



## My Visual Studio Code extensions

Who doesn't yet use Visual Studio Code in 2021? If you aren't yet using it, DO IT!! JUST DO IT! It's totally worth it and doesn't weight too much if compared to other GUI editors like Sublime Text ecc.
